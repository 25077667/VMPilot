# VMPilot: A Modern C++ Virtual Machine SDK

VMPilot is an advanced virtual machine software development kit (SDK) implemented in C++. **Secure by design**, VMPilot is specifically engineered to safeguard your software from reverse engineering. Offering seamless integration and ease of use for your projects, VMPilot sets a new standard for software protection.

Unlike traditional black box solutions, VMPilot is built with transparency in mind. Its inner workings are easily understandable, yet formidable to crack. By incorporating modern cryptography and obfuscation techniques, your software is shielded against potential attacks. Even with the computing power of a supercomputer, breaking VMPilot in parallel becomes a daunting challenge.

Experience the power of VMPilot and fortify your software against reverse engineering threats.

## Expected Usage
Similar to VMProtect:
```cpp
#include <vmpilot/sdk.hpp>

template <typename T>
T square(T x) {
    VMPilot_Begin(__FUNCTION__);
    auto result = x * x;
    VMPilot_End(__FUNCTION__);
    return result;
}
```

Output:
```asm
square:
    push rbp
    call    _Z13VMPilot_BeginPKc    ; VMPilot_Begin(__FUNCTION__);
    ... garbage code ...
    ... garbage code ...
    ... garbage code ...
    call    _Z11VMPilot_EndPKc      ; VMPilot_End(__FUNCTION__);
    pop rbp
    ret
```
